Coursier can be used as a Scala library. Its main dependency is
```
io.get-coursier::coursier:@VERSION@
```

The pages that follow document how to use coursier via these libraries.

Most pages assume that the content of the `coursier` package has been imported,
like
```scala mdoc:silent
import coursier._
```
